# Begin with Data
Introductory page for learning to access NASA data
<p>Let's unravel the process of putting NASA data to work to address your questions on the impacts of climate change on specific locations compared to the planet. This introduction should also be helpful for anyone working on a Space Apps Challenge or interested in some other application of NASA data.
<p><b>Getting Started</b> - If you are reading this, you know GitHub is an easy way to share code fragments with partners who can collaborate on a project. What you need to know now is how to access the data you want to explore using the new open source platform called VEDA. Here is the documentation: <a href="https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/services/jupyterhub.html">nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/services/jupyterhub.html</a>. You will also need access to a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>, so you'll need to make an account.
